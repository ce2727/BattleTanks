# Game Design Document

## World
The world of this game will be a low poly, mountain surrounded, hilly play area. The landscape may also include some props later on.
All dynamic features of the world will be there in order to allow for more tactical tank gameplay.

## Player
At least to start, the game will feature a simple tank mesh for all players. The controlls will be fairly accurate to a typical tank
in real life.

## Basic Overview
The tanks will shoot at eachother, attempting to kill eachother :)
